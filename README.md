## Roadmap

In the coming months we will be migrating to a more dynamic webpage. Here are some of the changes we could use your help on:

- Completing the Projects page so we can highlight some of the cool things .devclub and it's members are doing.
- Adding RSS feeds from our social media pages for a more dynamic look and feel
- Outlining clear collaboration and coding standards for this and future projects
- Making our website more accessible
